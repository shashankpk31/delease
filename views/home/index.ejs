                We have a well constituted & strict privacy policy. In brief the
                policy states that: We don't share our customer data with
                anybody. We donâ€™t have any such so called partner sites with
                whom we share data. No unsolicited emails are sent from us. We
                send occasional emails to you to keep you informed about our
                services but only to those customers who have instructed us to
                do so. The instructions can be modified by loging into the
                customer section.

                Delivery charge is Rs 100/- for normal time and big cities. If
                you want to deliver in Late Night (9 PM to 11:30 PM) or Mid
                Night (11:30 PM to 12:00 Mid Night), delivery charges would be
                Rs 300/-. For small city, where our vendor has to move from long
                distance, delivery charge is Rs 300/-. When you place the order,
                It shows delivery charges with respect of timing and cities.

                As soon as we receive the order, an order confirmation email is

                get Credit Card Authorization, the same is updated in the order
                tracking section and an email is sent to you. This may take few
                seconds to several minutes. If you have not received the email,
                you can verify the payment status through order tracking. If in
                the order tracking section, the card status is not verified and
                it has been some time that you have not got our email, then you
                can again make the payment by clicking on the link "Pay Now". By
                doing so through this link you will be charged just once, though
                you may get a new order number. Or you can email us on
